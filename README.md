# Spotify AI blocklist
Constantly growing list of shameless verified artists account on spotify distributing artificially created music.

### Spicetify trashbin
If you so happen to be using [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app), you can use the builtin trashbin extension for blocking ai crap. Just import the [spicetify-trashbin.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eye-wave/spotify-ai-blocklist/refs/heads/main/ai-trashbin.txt) in the extension settings, or extend your own trashbin with it.

### How to distinguish AI accounts

> [!WARNING]
> Some of these can also appy to legit accounts, this is not a full proof method, just what most of these accounts have in common.
> This also applies to this very list, since im just a human too and can make mistakes.

Check if suspected account has any of the following:

- releases before the year 2022
- unnatural robotic song lyrics and profile descriptions
- ai artwork overuse

For individual songs i personally judge them by ear. Because of how these models were trained, they all have that very specific _smeared sound quality_ mostly present in the highend of the spectrum, which is mostly noticable on **vocals**, **synths** and sometimes in some instruments too.

If you can't recognize this type of sound, or are just unsure, make sure to check the account for the clues listed eariler. Newer ai models are way better at hiding this characteristic artifact making the _judgment by ear_ more and more difficult as times goes on.
